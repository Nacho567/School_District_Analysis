## **Report Findings**
In looking at the analysis of the data, the overall theme that repeats is that Charter schools have generally higher scores while having smaller budgets, making them more effecient. They do have a larger dropoff of math scores than Public schools as students move up in grades. It would be worthwhile to compare the budgets of the types of schools with the total number of students, to see how much is being spent per student. It would also be beneficial to see the reading scores over time for the types of schools, to see if it also has a dropoff like the math scores.
